# CS61A-FA21

This repository contains my codes for the labs, homework, and projects of the course CS61A - SICP (Fall 2021) from UC Berkeley.

This is the [link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa21/) to the course website.

I did not write the hw, labs, and projects for Scheme and SQL contents, but only skimmed through the lectures on these topics.

The reason is that I am not personally so much into Scheme.

For SQL, I want to study it in depth some time later (before I study Databases), whereas CS 61A did not go in depth into SQL but just talked a little about its basics.
