There are in total 4 projects throughout the course, but I did not do the last one.  Because the last project is about writing a Scheme project,
and I am persoanlly not so much interested in Scheme for the moment.

Project 1, Hog, was about a gambling game, which used mainly Higher Order Functions.
Project 2, Cats, was about a typing game, which used mainly List Comprehensions and Recursions.
Project 3, Ants, was like Plants versus Zombies (but Ants versus SomeBees), which mainly used Object-Oriented Programming.

I personally enjoyed Project 3 the most as I enjoy the game Plants versus Zombies a lot.
